## 1. Dataset
## Download
[Download here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uVOmNCcsWE_w_pEEEMhAEQ)  
Access code: `8tsu`

## Additional version
We provide researchers with a fine-grained categorized version of the semantic segmentation of Xseg, a total of 32 categories of common contraband, the figure shows only part of the data example, called Xseg-semangtic, if you need it, you can contact the author to get it.<br>

## DATA Pipeline
We provide a reasonable pipeline for contraband dataset construction to build high-quality datasets and design a model Adaptive Point SAM (APSAM) specifically for contraband segmentation annotation task. APSAM is user-friendly enough and has superior segmentation performance.

## 2. Setup
Our development is based on the SAMUS source code, thanks to the contribution of the SAMUS repository!

## Getting Start
```python
conda create -n apsam python=3.9
conda activate apsam
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Starting Checkpoint

[sam-vit-b](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)

We make apsam's checkpoint public after the paper has been accepted!

## Training
```python
cd APSAM
python train.py --modelname APSAM --task <your dataset config name>
```

---

## To-Do List
* [√] Making XSeg public
* [√] Provide training and testing code for APSAM.
* [×] Checkpoints for APSAM will be made public.
